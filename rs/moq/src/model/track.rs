//! A track is a collection of semi-reliable and semi-ordered streams, split into a [TrackProducer] and [TrackConsumer] handle.
//!
//! A [TrackProducer] creates streams with a sequence number and priority.
//! The sequest number is used to determine the order of streams, while the priority is used to determine which stream to transmit first.
//! This may seem counter-intuitive, but is designed for live streaming where the newest streams may be higher priority.
//! A cloned [Producer] can be used to create streams in parallel, but will error if a duplicate sequence number is used.
//!
//! A [TrackConsumer] may not receive all streams in order or at all.
//! These streams are meant to be transmitted over congested networks and the key to MoQ Tranport is to not block on them.
//! streams will be cached for a potentially limited duration added to the unreliable nature.
//! A cloned [Consumer] will receive a copy of all new stream going forward (fanout).
//!
//! The track is closed with [Error] when all writers or readers are dropped.
